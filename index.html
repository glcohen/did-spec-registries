    <h1>The Registration Process</h1>
    <p>
Software implementers may find that the existing Decentralized Identifier
Core specification [[DID-CORE]] is not suitable for their use case and
might need to add a new parameters, properties, or classes to this registry
in order to achieve their use case in a globally interoperable fashion.
In order to add a new parameter, property, or class to this registry, an
implementer MUST:
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
The DID WG is currently determining the process for managing entries for this
registry.
    </p>

    <ol>

TBD
      </li>
      <li>
TBD
      </li>
      <li>
TBD
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
Additions that do not meet these criteria will not be accepted. Entries that
are identified to cause interoperability problems MAY be marked as such
at the discretion of the maintainers of this registry, and if possible, after
consultation with the entry maintainer.

as parameters in a DID URL.
