# Decentralized Identifier Core Registries v1.0

This repository contains a registry created by the
[W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/)
(DID WG) for the purpose of enhancing DID ecosystem interoperability.

An Editor's Draft of this repository is available at
https://w3c.github.io/did-core-registries/.

## CI Tests

This repo uses Github Actions to protect registry definitions and highlight interoperability and compliance issues regarding specific DID Methods.

In order to get your DID Method added to this repo you must.

1. Edit the [focusedMethods](./tests/focusedMethods.js) to include your did method as it is registerd, eg for `did:web:example.com`, `'web'`.

2. Edit the [universal-resolver-config.json](./tests/universal-resolver-config.json), to ensure that your did method is defined and that there is a testIdentifier, for example: `"testIdentifiers": ["did:web:example.com"]`.

3. Build a resolver cache entry for your did method: `npm run build-resolver-cache`.

4. Commit the changes to a branch and open a PR against master.

These test documents must be updated from time to time to accurately reflect their current represenations provided by the universal resolver.

In order to get the latest representation from the Universal Resolver, you will need to delete the existing did document from [test-dids](./test-dids), and re-run:

`npm run build-resolver-cache`

Then commit the changes to a branch and open a PR against master.

In the future, we may decide to add this download step to CI.
